At the end of all we are human beings and from scientific perspective we are Homo sapiens. But science cannot control all the activities that we perform throughout our life. In another way science is in our control. Therefore, our actions are the result of our perspective and the way to try to achieve our goals or lead or life.
But the question that remains is that do we control all our deeds that are being executed by us throughout our life?

Let me tell you very clearly that the answer is NO. Though many people have the misconception that all our deeds that we execute are decided by the way we perceive everything. I think many of us have felt it at some point in our life or the other that we have done something which we never meant to do and finally we call them our mistakes. After accomplishing such a task we realize that we were actually not willing to do that task that we have done. And finally we come up with an expression "Shit! What have I have I done?!! How can I do this?!" But think minutely, was that really our fault to commit such a task which we never meant to do. So, if we have such a repulsive feelings towards committing such a task, how can we consider ourselves guilt-ridden or responsible for committing such a task? 
Nevertheless, as the deed is performed by us so we finally it turns out to be our Karma. While talking about Karma, let us know that there are two types of Kriya (action). One is Nishkaam Kriya (an action where the intention or any motif of the person is not involved) and the other one is Sakaam Kriya (an action where the intention of the person is involved along with all his desires, wishes and motif).
So the pint is that our Nishkaam Kriya is our Nishkaam Kriya but if you are anyhow blamed for this that, just take a deep breath and think about your steep struggle, automatically the pointers perishing you with blame will be nullified for you and you will get some ease.

Still, as the action (Kriya) has been performed by you, one can hardly realize that it has been your Nishkaam Kriya where your intention has not been involved. So in such a scenario you might have gone through a lot which you may not expect for you. In such a context you may make use of the gathered power of all your sufferings for some better cause.  However, if you are going through lot don’t blame yourself in the first place and never ever think of giving up.

However, if you are put into such a topsy-turvy situation because of your Nishkaam Kriya God will definitely find a way out for you but after a lot of test and trails, so you must have all your patience and perseverance stored in your heart to finally achieve his grace.  So never giving up is the policy.
Whether your Kariya is Nishkaarm or Sakaaarm you should always clear your conscience in front of God’s altar to get a sigh of relief that you are at least clear to the almighty. But while clearing your conscience should not hide the blemishes of your guilt-ridden heart because this is finally a process of confession to God.

The Goddess may fail to protect you from all the Raktabeejas  in the real scenario but the process of your confession and clearing conscience will give your some emotional strength and relief. 

We have all come across the theory of Evolution by Charles Robert Darwin and we have come to know how humans have come into being from the shape of an ape to this stage where his intelligence knows no bound, which is also proved by the advancement of science.
Though, Science, the present day, almighty comes up with plethora of solutions in various spheres but it may fail to connect each loose ends got detached from your life. So, there is something beyond and we must revere it. 

However, if your work is Sakaam you may have to go through an acute emotional purgation and in most of the cases followed by a repentance.  But what matters more than repentance is a change of realization.

If your Sakaam Kriya is positive that’s well but if there is a little glitch in your Sakaam Kriya and therefore in your conscience you should always try to purge that with the passing time and hopefully there will be no remorse in your heart. 

Therefore, a clear conscience with Nishkaam and positive Shakaam Karma will always boost your self-respect and on the other hand you will have to purge yourself a little.
